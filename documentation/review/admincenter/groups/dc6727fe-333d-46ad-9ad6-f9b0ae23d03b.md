### Description

Shared mailboxes are used when multiple people need access to the same mailbox, such as a company information or support email address, reception desk, or other function that might be shared by multiple people. 

Users with permissions to the group mailbox can send as or send on behalf of the mailbox email address if the administrator has given that user permissions to do that. This is particularly useful for help and support mailboxes because users can send emails from "Contoso Support" or "Building A Reception Desk." 

Shared mailboxes are created with a corresponding user account using a system generated password that is unknown at the time of creation.

The recommended state is Sign in blocked for Shared mailboxes. 

### Technical explanation

The intent of the shared mailbox is the only allow delegated access from other mailboxes. An admin could reset the password or an attacker could potentially gain access to the shared mailbox allowing the direct sign-in to the shared mailbox and subsequently the sending of email from a sender that does not have a unique identity. To prevent this, block sign-in for the account that is associated with the shared mailbox.
