### Description

IExternal calendar sharing allows an administrator to enable the ability for users to share calendars with anyone outside of the organization. Outside users will be sent a URL that can be used to view the calendar.

### Technical explanation

Attackers often spend time learning about organizations before launching an attack. Publicly available calendars can help attackers understand organizational relationships and determine when specific users may be more vulnerable to an attack, such as when they are traveling.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 admin center https://admin.microsoft.com. 
2. Click to expand **Settings** select **Org settings**. 
3. In the Services section click **Calendar**. 
4. Uncheck **Let your users share their calendars with people outside of your organization who have Office 365 or Exchange**. 
5. Click **Save**.
