### Description

The Exchange Online environment can be configured in a way that allows for automatic forwarding of e-mail. This can be done using Transport Rules in the Admin Center, Auto Forwarding per mailbox, and client-based rules in Outlook. Administrators and users both are given several methods to automatically and quickly send e-mails outside of your organization.

### Technical explanation

Reviewing mail forwarding rules will provide the Messaging Administrator with insight into possible attempts to exfiltrate data from the organization. Weekly review helps create a recognition of baseline, legitimate activity of users. This will aid in helping identify the more malicious activity of bad actors when/if they choose to use this side-channel.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Exchange admin center https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com.

2. Expand **Reports** then select **Mail flow**.

3. Click on **Auto forwarded messages report**.

4. Review.
