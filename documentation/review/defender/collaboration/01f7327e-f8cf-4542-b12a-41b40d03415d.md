### Description

Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is the cloud-based filtering service that protects organizations against spam, malware, and other email threats. EOP is included in all Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes.

EOP uses flexible anti-malware policies for malware protection settings. These policies can be set to notify Admins of malicious activity.

### Technical explanation

This setting alerts administrators that an internal user sent a message that contained malware. This may indicate an account or machine compromise that would need to be investigated.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 Defender https://security.microsoft.com.

2. Click to expand **E-mail & Collaboration** select Policies & rules.

3. On the Policies & rules page select **Threat policies**.

4. Under Policies select Anti-malware.

5. Click on the **Default (Default)** policy.

6. Click on Edit protection settings and change the settings for **Notify an admin about undelivered messages from internal senders** to **On** and enter the email address of the administrator who should be notified under Administrator email address.

7. Click **Save**.
