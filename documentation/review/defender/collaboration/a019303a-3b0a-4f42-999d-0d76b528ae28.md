### Description

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online or standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) organizations without Exchange Online mailboxes, email messages are automatically protected against spam (junk email) by EOP.
Configure Exchange Online Spam Policies to copy emails and notify someone when a sender in the organization has been blocked for sending spam emails.

### Technical explanation

A blocked account is a good indication that the account in question has been breached and an attacker is using it to send spam emails to other people.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 Defender https://security.microsoft.com.

2. Click to expand **Email & collaboration** select **Policies & rules** > **Threat policies**.

4. Click on the **Anti-spam outbound policy (default)**.

5. Select **Edit protection settings** then under **Notifications**

6. Check **Send a copy of outbound messages that exceed these limits to these users and groups then enter the desired email addresses**.
