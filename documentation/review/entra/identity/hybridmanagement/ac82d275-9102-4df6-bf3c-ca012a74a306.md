### Description

Password hash synchronization is one of the sign-in methods used to accomplish hybrid identity synchronization. Azure AD Connect synchronizes a hash, of the hash, of a user's password from an on-premises Active Directory instance to a cloud-based Azure AD instance.

### Technical explanation

Password hash synchronization helps by reducing the number of passwords your users need to maintain to just one and enables leaked credential detection for your hybrid accounts. Leaked credential protection is leveraged through Azure AD Identity Protection and is a subset of that feature which can help identify if an organization's user account passwords have appeared on the dark web or public spaces.

Using other options for your directory synchronization may be less resilient as Microsoft can still process sign-ins to 365 with Hash Sync even if a network connection to your on-premises environment is not available.

### Advised solution

1. Log in to the on premises server that hosts the Azure AD Connect tool

2. Double-click the **Azure AD Connect** icon that was created on the desktop

3. Click **Configure**.

4. On the **Additional tasks** page, select **Customize synchronization options** and click **Next**.

5. Enter the username and password for your global administrator.

6. On the Connect your directories screen, click **Next**.

7. On the Domain and OU filtering screen, click **Next**.

8. On the Optional features screen, check **Password hash synchronization** and click **Next**.

9. On the Ready to configure screen click **Configure**.

10. Once the configuration completes, click **Exit**.
