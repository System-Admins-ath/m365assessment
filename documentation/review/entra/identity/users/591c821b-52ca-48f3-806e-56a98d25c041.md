### Description

Restrict non-privileged users from signing into the Azure Active Directory portal.

### Technical explanation

The Azure AD administrative (AAD) portal contains sensitive data and permission settings, which are still enforced based on the user's role. However, an end user may inadvertently change properties or account settings that could result in increased administrative overhead. Additionally, a compromised end user account could be used by a malicious attacker as a means to gather additional information and escalate an attack.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Entra admin center https://entra.microsoft.com/
2. Click to expand **Identity** > **Users** > **User settings**.
3. Set **Restrict access to Microsoft Entra ID administration portal** to **Yes** then **Save**.
