### Description

Security defaults in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) make it easier to be secure and help protect the organization. Security defaults contain preconfigured security settings for common attacks.

By default, Microsoft enables security defaults. The goal is to ensure that all organizations have a basic level of security enabled. The security default setting is manipulated in the Azure Portal.

The use of security defaults, however, will prohibit custom settings which are being set with more advanced settings from this benchmark.

### Technical explanation

Security defaults provide secure default settings that are managed on behalf of organizations to keep customers safe until they are ready to manage their own identity security settings.
For example, doing the following:

- Requiring all users and admins to register for MFA.
- Challenging users with MFA - mostly when they show up on a new device or app, but more often for critical roles and tasks.
- Disabling authentication from legacy authentication clients, which canâ€™t do MFA.

### Advised solution

2. Click to expand **Identity** select **Overview**
3. Click **Properties**.
