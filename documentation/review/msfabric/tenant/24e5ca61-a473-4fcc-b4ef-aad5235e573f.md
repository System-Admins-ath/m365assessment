### Description

This setting allows Azure AD B2B guest users to have full access to the browsing experience using the left-hand navigation pane in the organization. Guest users who have been assigned workspace roles or specific item permissions will continue to have those roles and/or permissions, even if this setting is disabled.

The recommended state is Enabled for a subset of the organization or Disabled.

### Technical explanation

Establishing and enforcing a dedicated security group prevents unauthorized access to Microsoft Fabric for guests collaborating in Azure that are new or assigned guest status from other applications. This upholds the principle of least privilege and uses role-based access control (RBAC). These security groups can also be used for tasks like conditional access, enhancing risk management and user accountability across the organization.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Fabric https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal

2. Select **Tenant settings**.

3. Scroll to **Export and Sharing settings**.

4. Set **Allow Azure Active Directory guest users to edit and manage content in the organization** to one of these states:
   - State 1: **Disabled**
   - State 2: **Enabled with Specific security groups** selected and defined.
