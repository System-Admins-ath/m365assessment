### Description

This setting blocks the use of resource key based authentication. The Block ResourceKey Authentication setting applies to streaming and PUSH datasets. If blocked users will not be allowed send data to streaming and PUSH datasets using the API with a resource key.

The recommended state is Enabled.

### Technical explanation

Resource keys are a form of authentication that allows users to access Power BI resources (such as reports, dashboards, and datasets) without requiring individual user accounts. While convenient, this method bypasses the organization's centralized identity and access management controls. Enabling ensures that access to Power BI resources is tied to the organization's authentication mechanisms, providing a more secure and controlled environment.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Fabric https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal
