### Description

This setting allows business-to-business (B2B) guests access to Microsoft Fabric, and contents that they have permissions to. With the setting turned off, B2B guest users receive an error when trying to access Power BI.

The recommended state is Enabled for a subset of the organization or Disabled.

### Technical explanation

Establishing and enforcing a dedicated security group prevents unauthorized access to Microsoft Fabric for guests collaborating in Azure that are new or assigned guest status from other applications. This upholds the principle of least privilege and uses role-based access control (RBAC). These security groups can also be used for tasks like conditional access, enhancing risk management and user accountability across the organization.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Fabric https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal

2. Select **Tenant settings**.

3. Scroll to **Export and Sharing settings**.

4. Set **Allow Azure Active Directory guest users to access Microsoft Fabric** to one of these states:
   - State 1: **Disabled**
   - State 2: **Enabled with Specific security groups** selected and defined.
