### Description

This setting governs the global permissiveness of OneDrive content sharing in the organization.
OneDrive content sharing can be restricted independent of SharePoint but can never be more permissive than the level established with SharePoint.

The recommended state is Only people in your organization.

### Technical explanation

OneDrive, designed for end-user cloud storage, inherently provides less oversight and control compared to SharePoint, which often involves additional content overseers or site administrators. This autonomy can lead to potential risks such as inadvertent sharing of privileged information by end users. Restricting external OneDrive sharing will require users to transfer content to SharePoint folders first which have those tighter controls.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to SharePoint admin center https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint

2. Click to expand **Policies** > **Sharing**.

3. Locate the **External sharing** section.

4. Under **OneDrive**, set the slider bar to **Only people in your organization**.
