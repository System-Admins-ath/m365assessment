### Description

SharePoint gives users the ability to share files, folders, and site collections. Internal users can share with external collaborators, and with the right permissions could share to other external parties.

### Technical explanation

Sharing and collaboration are key; however, file, folder, or site collection owners should have the authority over what external users get shared with to prevent unauthorized disclosures of information.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to SharePoint admin center https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint

2. Click to expand **Policies** then select **Sharing**.

3. Expand **More external sharing settings**, uncheck **Allow guests to share items they don't own**.

4. Click **Save**.
