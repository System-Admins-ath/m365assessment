### Description

Exchange Online offers several methods of managing the flow of email messages. These are Remote domain, Transport Rules, and Anti-spam outbound policies. These methods work together to provide comprehensive coverage for potential automatic forwarding channels:

- Outlook forwarding using inbox rules
- Outlook forwarding configured using OOF rule
- OWA forwarding setting (ForwardingSmtpAddress)
- Forwarding set by the admin using EAC (ForwardingAddress)
- Forwarding using Power Automate / Flow

Ensure a Transport rule and Anti-spam outbound policy are used to block mail forwarding.

### Technical explanation

Attackers often create these rules to exfiltrate data from your tenancy, this could be accomplished via access to an end-user account or otherwise. An insider could also use one of these methods as a secondary channel to exfiltrate sensitive data.

### Advised solution

1. Open the Exchange admin center through https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com.

2. Select **Mail Flow** then **Rules**.

3. For each rule that redirects email to external domains, select the rule and click the '**Delete**' icon.
