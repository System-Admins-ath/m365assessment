### Description

Enabling self-service password reset allows users to reset their own passwords in Azure AD. When users sign in to Microsoft 365, they will be prompted to enter additional contact information that will help them reset their password in the future. If combined registration is enabled additional information, outside of multi-factor, will not be needed.

### Technical explanation

Users will no longer need to engage the helpdesk for password resets, and the password reset mechanism will automatically block common, easily guessable passwords.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Entra admin center https://entra.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Protection** > **Password reset** select **Properties**.

3. Set **Self service password reset enabled** to **All**
