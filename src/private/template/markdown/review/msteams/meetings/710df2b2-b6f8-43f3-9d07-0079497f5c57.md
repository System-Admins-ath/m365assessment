### Description

This policy setting controls if users who dial in by phone can join the meeting directly or must wait in the lobby. Admittance to the meeting from the lobby is authorized by the meeting organizer, co-organizer, or presenter of the meeting.

### Technical explanation

For meetings that could contain sensitive information, it is best to allow the meeting organizer to vet anyone not directly from the organization.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Teams admin center https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Meetings** select **Meeting policies**.

3. Click **Global (Org-wide default)**

4. Under meeting join & lobby set **People dialing in can't bypass the lobby** is set to **Off**.
