### Description

Microsoft Teams enables collaboration via file sharing. This file sharing is conducted within Teams, using SharePoint Online, by default; however, third-party cloud services are allowed as well.

### Technical explanation

Ensuring that only authorized cloud storage providers are accessible from Teams will help to dissuade the use of non-approved storage providers.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Teams admin center https://admin.teams.microsoft.com.

2. Click to expand **Teams** select **Teams settings**.

3. Set any unauthorized providers to **Off**.
