### Description

Power BI enables users to share reports and materials directly on the internet from both the application's desktop version and its web user interface. This functionality generates a publicly reachable web link that doesn't necessitate authentication or the need to be an AAD user in order to access and view it.

The recommended state is Enabled for a subset of the organization or Disabled.

### Technical explanation

When using Publish to the Web anyone on the Internet can view a published report or visual. Viewing requires no authentication. It includes viewing detail-level data that your reports aggregate. By disabling the feature, restricting access to certain users and allowing existing embed codes organizations can mitigate the exposure of confidential or proprietary information.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Fabric https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal

2. Select **Tenant settings**.

3. Scroll to **Export and Sharing settings**.

4. Set **Publish to the web** to one of these states:
   - State 1: **Disabled**
   - State 2: **Enabled** with **Choose how embed codes work** set to **Only allow existing codes** AND **Specific security groups** selected and defined.
