### Description

Power BI allows the integration of R and Python scripts directly into visuals. This feature allows data visualizations by incorporating custom calculations, statistical analyses, machine learning models, and more using R or Python scripts. Custom visuals can be created by embedding them directly into Power BI reports. Users can then interact with these visuals and see the results of the custom code within the Power BI interface.

### Technical explanation

Disabling this feature can reduce the attack surface by preventing potential malicious code execution leading to data breaches, or unauthorized access. The potential for sensitive or confidential data being leaked to unintended users is also increased with the use of scripts.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Fabric https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal

2. Select **Tenant settings**.

3. Scroll to **R and Python visuals settings**.

4. 4.Set **Interact with and share R and Python visuals** to **Disabled**
