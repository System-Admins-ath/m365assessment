### Description

Power BI admins can specify which users or user groups can share datasets externally with guests from a different tenant through the in-place mechanism. Disabling this setting prevents any user from sharing datasets externally by restricting the ability of users to turn on external sharing for datasets they own or manage.

The recommended state is Enabled for a subset of the organization or Disabled.

### Technical explanation

Establishing and enforcing a dedicated security group prevents unauthorized access to Microsoft Fabric for guests collaborating in Azure that are new or from other applications. This upholds the principle of least privilege and uses role-based access control (RBAC). These security groups can also be used for tasks like conditional access, enhancing risk management and user accountability across the organization.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Fabric https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal

2. Select **Tenant settings**.

3. Scroll to **Export and Sharing settings**.

4. Set **Allow specific users to turn on external data sharing** to one of these states:
   1. State 1: **Disabled**

   2. State 2: **Enabled** with **Specific security groups** selected and defined.
