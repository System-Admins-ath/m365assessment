### Description

Control sharing of documents to external domains by either blocking domains or only allowing sharing with specific named domains.

### Technical explanation

Attackers will often attempt to expose sensitive information to external entities through sharing, and restricting the domains that users can share documents with will reduce that surface area.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to SharePoint admin center https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint

2. Expand **Policies** then click **Sharing**.

3. Expand **More external sharing settings** and check **Limit external sharing by domain**.

4. Select **Add domains** to add a list of approved domains.

5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.
