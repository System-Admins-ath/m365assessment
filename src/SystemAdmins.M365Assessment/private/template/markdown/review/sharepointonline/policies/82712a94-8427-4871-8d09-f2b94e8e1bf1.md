### Description

This setting configures if guests who use a verification code to access the site or links are required to reauthenticate after a set number of days.

The recommended state is 15 or less.

### Technical explanation

By increasing the frequency of times guests need to reauthenticate this ensures guest user access to data is not prolonged beyond an acceptable amount of time.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to SharePoint admin center https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint

2. Expand **Policies** then click **Sharing**.

3. Scroll to and expand **More external sharing settings**.

4. Set **People who use a verification code must reauthenticate after this** to **15** or less.
