### Description

This setting sets the default link type that a user will see when sharing content in OneDrive or SharePoint. It does not restrict or exclude any other options.

The recommended state is Specific people (only the people the user specifies)

### Technical explanation

By defaulting to specific people, the user will first need to consider whether or not the content being shared should be accessible by the entire organization versus select individuals. This aids in reinforcing the concept of least privilege.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to SharePoint admin center https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint

2. Expand **Policies** then click **Sharing**.

3. Scroll to **Files and folder links**.

4. Set **Choose the type of link that's selected by default when users share files and folders in SharePoint and OneDrive** to **Specific people (only the people the user specifies)**
