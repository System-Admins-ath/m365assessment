### Description

This policy setting configures the expiration time for each guest that is invited to the SharePoint site or with whom users share individual files and folders with.

The recommended state is 30 or less.

### Technical explanation

This setting ensures that guests who no longer need access to the site or link no longer have access after a set period of time. Allowing guest access for an indefinite amount of time could lead to loss of data confidentiality and oversight.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to SharePoint admin center https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint

2. Expand **Policies** then click **Sharing**.

3. Scroll to and expand **More external sharing settings**.

4. Set **Guest access to a site or OneDrive will expire automatically after this many days** to **30**
