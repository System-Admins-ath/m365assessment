### Description

External sharing of content can be restricted to specific security groups. This setting is global, applies to sharing in both SharePoint and OneDrive and cannot be set at the site level in SharePoint.

The recommended state is Enabled or Checked.

### Technical explanation

Organizations wishing to create tighter security controls for external sharing can set this to enforce role-based access control by using security groups already defined in Microsoft Entra.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to SharePoint admin center https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint

2. Expand **Policies** then click **Sharing**.

3. Scroll to and expand **More external sharing settings**.

4. Set the following:
   - Check **Allow only users in specific security groups to share externally**
   - Define **Manage security groups** in accordance with company procedure.
