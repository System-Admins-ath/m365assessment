### Description

This setting controls custom script execution on OneDrive or user-created sites.
Custom scripts can allow users to change the look, feel and behavior of sites and pages. Every script that runs in a SharePoint page (whether it's an HTML page in a document library or a JavaScript in a Script Editor Web Part) always runs in the context of the user visiting the page and the SharePoint application. This means:

- Scripts have access to everything the user has access to.
- Scripts can access content across several Microsoft 365 services and even beyond with Microsoft Graph integration.

The recommended state is Prevent users from running custom script on personal sites and Prevent users from running custom script on self-service created sites

### Technical explanation

Custom scripts could contain malicious instructions unknown to the user or administrator. When users are allowed to run custom script, the organization can no longer enforce governance, scope the capabilities of inserted code, block specific parts of code, or block all custom code that has been deployed. If scripting is allowed the following things can't be audited:

- What code has been inserted
- Where the code has been inserted
- Who inserted the code

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to SharePoint admin center https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint

2. Select **Settings**.

3. At the bottom of the page click the **classic settings page** hyperlink.

4. Scroll to locate the **Custom Script** section. On the right set the following:
   - Select **Prevent users from running custom script on personal sites**.
   - Select **Prevent users from running custom script on self-service created sites**.
