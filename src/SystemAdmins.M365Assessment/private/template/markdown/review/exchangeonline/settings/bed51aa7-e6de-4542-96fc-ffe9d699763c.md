### Description

MailTips are informative messages displayed to users while they're composing a message. While a new message is open and being composed, Exchange analyzes the message (including recipients). If a potential problem is detected, the user is notified with a MailTip prior to sending the message. Using the information in the MailTip, the user can adjust the message to avoid undesirable situations or non-delivery reports (also known as NDRs or bounce messages).

### Technical explanation

Setting up MailTips gives a visual aid to users when they send emails to large groups of recipients or send emails to recipients not within the tenant.

### Advised solution

1. Run the Microsoft Exchange Online PowerShell Module.

2. Connect to Exchange Online using Connect-ExchangeOnline.

3. Run the following PowerShell command:

   ```powershell
   $TipsParams = @{ MailTipsAllTipsEnabled   = $true;
       MailTipsExternalRecipientsTipsEnabled = $true;
       MailTipsGroupMetricsEnabled           = $true;
       MailTipsLargeAudienceThreshold        = '25' 
   }
   
   Set-OrganizationConfig @TipsParams
   ```
