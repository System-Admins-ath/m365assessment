### Description

This setting allows users to open certain external files while working in Outlook on the web. If allowed, keep in mind that Microsoft doesn't control the use terms or privacy policies of those third-party services.

Ensure **AdditionalStorageProvidersAvailable** are restricted.

### Technical explanation

By default additional storage providers are allowed in Office on the Web (such as Box, Dropbox, Facebook, Google Drive, OneDrive Personal, etc.). This could lead to information leakage and additional risk of infection from organizational non-trusted storage providers. Restricting this will inherently reduce risk as it will narrow opportunities for infection and data leakage.

### Advised solution

1. Run the Microsoft Exchange Online PowerShell Module.

2. Connect to Exchange Online using Connect-ExchangeOnline.

3. Run the following PowerShell command:

   ```powershell
   Set-OwaMailboxPolicy -Identity OwaMailboxPolicy-Default -AdditionalStorageProvidersAvailable $false
   ```
