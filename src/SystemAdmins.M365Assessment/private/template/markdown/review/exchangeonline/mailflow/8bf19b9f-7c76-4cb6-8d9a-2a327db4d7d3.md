### Description

Mail flow rules (transport rules) in Exchange Online are used to identify and take action on messages that flow through the organization.

### Technical explanation

Whitelisting domains in transport rules bypasses regular malware and phishing scanning, which can enable an attacker to launch attacks against your users from a safe haven domain.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Exchange admin center https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com..
2. Click to expand **Mail Flow** and then select **Rules**.
3. Review the rules and verify that none of them whitelist any specific domains.
