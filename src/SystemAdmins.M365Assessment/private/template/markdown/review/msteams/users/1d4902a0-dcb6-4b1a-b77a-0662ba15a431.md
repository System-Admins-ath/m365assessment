### Description

This policy setting controls chat with external unmanaged Skype and Teams users. Users in the organization will not be searchable by unmanaged Skype or Teams users and will have to initiate all communications with unmanaged users.

### Technical explanation

Allowing users to communicate with Skype or Teams users outside of an organization presents a potential security threat as external users can interact with organization users over Skype for Business or Teams. While legitimate, productivity-improving scenarios exist, they are outweighed by the risk of data loss, phishing, and social engineering attacks against organization users via Teams. Therefore, it is recommended to restrict external communications in order to minimize the risk of security incidents.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Teams admin center https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Users** select **External access**.

3. Under **Teams and Skype for Business users in external organizations**

   Select **Block all external domains**

   - NOTE: If the organization's policy allows select any allowed external domains.

4. Under **Teams accounts not managed by an organization** move the slider to **Off**.

5. Under **Skype users** move the slider is to **Off**.

6. Click **Save**.
