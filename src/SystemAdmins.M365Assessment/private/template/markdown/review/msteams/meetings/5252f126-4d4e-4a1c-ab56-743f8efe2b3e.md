### Description

This policy setting controls who can join a meeting directly and who must wait in the lobby until they're admitted by an organizer, co-organizer, or presenter of the meeting.

### Technical explanation

For meetings that could contain sensitive information, it is best to allow the meeting organizer to vet anyone not directly sent an invite before admitting them to the meeting. This will also prevent the anonymous user from using the meeting link to have meetings at unscheduled times.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Teams admin center https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Meetings** select **Meeting policies**.

3. Click **Global (Org-wide default)**

4. Under meeting join & lobby set **Who can bypass the lobby** is set to **People in my org**.
