### Description

This policy setting can prevent anyone other than invited attendees (people directly invited by the organizer, or to whom an invitation was forwarded) from bypassing the lobby and entering the meeting.

### Technical explanation

For meetings that could contain sensitive information, it is best to allow the meeting organizer to vet anyone not directly sent an invite before admitting them to the meeting. This will also prevent the anonymous user from using the meeting link to have meetings at unscheduled times.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Teams admin center https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Meetings** select **Meeting policies**.

3. Click **Global (Org-wide default)**

4. Under meeting join & lobby set **Anonymous users can join a meeting** to **Off**.
