### Description

This policy setting allows control of who can present in meetings and who can request control of the presentation while a meeting is underway.

### Technical explanation

Ensuring that only authorized individuals and not external participants are able to present and request control reduces the risk that a malicious user can inadvertently show content that is not appropriate.

External participants are categorized as follows: external users, guests, and anonymous users.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Teams admin center https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Meetings** select **Meeting policies**.

3. Click **Global (Org-wide default)**

4. Under content sharing set **External participants can give or request control** to **Off**.
