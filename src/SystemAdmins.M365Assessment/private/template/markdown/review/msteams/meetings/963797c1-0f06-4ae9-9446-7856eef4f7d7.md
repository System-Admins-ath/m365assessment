### Description

This policy setting controls if an anonymous participant can start a Microsoft Teams meeting without someone in attendance. Anonymous users and dial-in callers must wait in the lobby until the meeting is started by someone in the organization or an external user from a trusted organization.
Anonymous participants are classified as:

- Participants who are not logged in to Teams with a work or school account.
- Participants from non-trusted organizations (as configured in external access).
- Participants from organizations where there is not mutual trust.

### Technical explanation

Not allowing anonymous participants to automatically join a meeting reduces the risk of meeting spamming.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Teams admin center https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Meetings** select **Meeting policies**.

3. Click **Global (Org-wide default)**

4. Under meeting join & lobby verify that **Anonymous users and dial-in callers can start a meeting** is set to **Off**.
