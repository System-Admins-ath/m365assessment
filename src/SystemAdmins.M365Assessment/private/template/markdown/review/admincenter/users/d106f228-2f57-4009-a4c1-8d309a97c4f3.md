### Description

More than one global administrator should be designated so a single admin can be monitored and to provide redundancy should a single admin leave an organization. Additionally, there should be no more than four global admins set for any tenant. Ideally global administrators will have no licenses assigned to them.

### Technical explanation

If there is only one global tenant administrator, he or she can perform malicious activity without the possibility of being discovered by another admin. If there are numerous global tenant administrators, the more likely it is that one of their accounts will be successfully breached by an external attacker.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to the Microsoft 365 admin center https://admin.microsoft.com

   3. Select **Manage roles**. 
   4. Select Admin center access. 
   5. Check **Global Administrator**. 
   6. Click **Save changes**. 

5. To remove Global Admins:
