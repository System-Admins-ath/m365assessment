### Description

A dynamic group is a dynamic configuration of security group membership for Azure Active Directory. Administrators can set rules to populate groups that are created in Azure AD based on user attributes (such as userType, department, or country/region). Members can be automatically added to or removed from a security group based on their attributes.

### Technical explanation

Dynamic groups allow for an automated method to assign group membership.

Guest user accounts will be automatically added to this group and through this existing conditional access rules, access controls and other security measures will ensure that new guest accounts are restricted in the same manner as existing guest accounts.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Entra admin center https://entra.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Identity** > **Groups** select **All groups**.

3. Select **New group** and assign the following values:

   - **Group type:** Security
   - **Azure AD Roles can be assigned:** No
   - **Membership type:** Dynamic User

4. Select **Add dynamic query**.

5. Above the Rule syntax text box, select **Edit**.

6. Place the following expression in the box:

   **(user.userType -eq "Guest")**

7. Select **OK** and **Save**
