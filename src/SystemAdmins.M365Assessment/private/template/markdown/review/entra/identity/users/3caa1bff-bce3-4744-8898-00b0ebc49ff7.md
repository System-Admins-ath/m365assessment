### Description

App registrations allows users to register custom-developed applications for use within the directory.

### Technical explanation

Third party integrated applications connection to services should be disabled, unless there is a very clear value and robust security controls are in place. While there are legitimate uses, attackers can grant access from breached accounts to third party applications to exfiltrate data from your tenancy without having to maintain the breached account.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Entra admin center https://entra.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Identity** > **Users** select **Users settings**.

3. Set **Users can register applications** to **No**.

4. Click **Save**.
