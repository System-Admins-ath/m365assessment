### Description

The option for the user to Stay signed in or the Keep me signed in option will prompt a user after a successful login, when the user selects this option a persistent refresh token is created. Typically this lasts for 90 days and does not prompt for sign-in or Multi-Factor.

### Technical explanation

Allowing users to select this option presents risk, especially in the event that the user signs into their account on a publicly accessible computer/web browser. In this case it would be trivial for an unauthorized person to gain access to any associated cloud data from that account.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft Entra admin center https://entra.microsoft.com/.

2. Click to expand **Identity** > **Users** > **User settings**.

3. Set **Show keep user signed in** to **No**.

4. Click **Save**.
