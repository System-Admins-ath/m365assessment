### Description

The default Teams Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy rule in Microsoft 365 is a preconfigured rule that is automatically applied to all Teams conversations and channels. The default rule helps prevent accidental sharing of sensitive information by detecting and blocking certain types of content that are deemed sensitive or inappropriate by the organization.

By default, the rule includes sensitive information types, such as credit card numbers and social security numbers, and applies to all users in the organization.
