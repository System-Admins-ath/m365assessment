### Description

Role-Based Access Control allows for permissions to be assigned to users based on their roles within an organization. It is a more manageable form of access control that is less prone to errors. These user roles can be audited inside of Microsoft Purview to provide a security auditor insight into user privilege change.

### Technical explanation

Weekly reviews provide an opportunity to identify rights changes in an organization and are a large part of maintaining Least Privilege and preventing Privilege creep. Insider Threats, either intentional or unintentional, can occur when a user has higher than needed privileges. Maintaining accountability of role membership will keep insiders and malicious actors limited in the scope of potential damaging activities.
