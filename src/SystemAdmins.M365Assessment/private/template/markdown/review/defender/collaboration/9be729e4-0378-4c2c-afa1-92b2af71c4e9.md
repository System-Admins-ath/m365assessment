### Description

For each domain that is configured in Exchange, a corresponding Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record should be created.

### Technical explanation

SPF records allow Exchange Online Protection and other mail systems to know where messages from domains are allowed to originate. This information can be used by that system to determine how to treat the message based on if it is being spoofed or is valid.

### Advised solution

1. If all email in your domain is sent from and received by Exchange Online, add the following TXT record for each Accepted Domain:

   **v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all**

2. If there are other systems that send email in the environment, refer to this article for the proper SPF configuration:
