### Description

DMARC, or Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, assists recipient mail systems in determining the appropriate action to take when messages from a domain fail to meet SPF or DKIM authentication criteria.

### Technical explanation

DMARC strengthens the trustworthiness of messages sent from an organization's domain to destination email systems. By integrating DMARC with SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), organizations can significantly enhance their defenses against email spoofing and phishing attempts.

### Advised solution

1. For each Exchange Online Accepted Domain, add the following record to DNS:

   ```
   Record: _dmarc.contoso.com
   Type: TXT Value: v=DMARC1; p=none;
   ```

2. This will create a basic DMARC policy that audits compliance.
