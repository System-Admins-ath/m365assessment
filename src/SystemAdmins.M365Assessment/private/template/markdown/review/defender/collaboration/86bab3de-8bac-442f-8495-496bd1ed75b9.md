### Description

Microsoft 365 Defender reviews of Restricted Entities will provide a list of user accounts restricted from sending e-mail. If a user exceeds one of the outbound sending limits as specified in the service limits or in outbound spam policies, the user is restricted from sending email, but they can still receive email.

### Technical explanation

Users who are found on the restricted users list have a high probability of having been compromised. Review of this list will allow an organization to remediate these user accounts, and then unblock them.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 Defender https://security.microsoft.com.
2. Under **Email & collaboration** navigate to **Review**.
3. Click **Restricted Entities**.
4. Review alerts and take appropriate action (unblocking) after account has been remediated.
