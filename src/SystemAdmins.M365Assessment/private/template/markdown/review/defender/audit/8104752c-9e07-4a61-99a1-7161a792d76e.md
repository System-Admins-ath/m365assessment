### Description

Non-global administrator role group assignments should be reviewed at least every week.

### Technical explanation

While these roles are less powerful than a global admin, they do grant special privileges that can be used illicitly. If unusual activity is detected, contact the user to confirm it is a legitimate need.

### Advised solution

1. Navigate to Microsoft 365 Defender https://security.microsoft.com.

2. Click on **Audit**.

3. Set **Added member to Role** and **Removed a user from a directory role** for **Activities**.

4. Set **Start Date** and **End Date**.

5. Click **Search**.

6. Review.
